--------------------------------
average turnaround time 
    should be W + R
    or 
    exit time - arrival time

average wait time
    W+ all elements in IO queue and all elements in CPUQ that are not front element

average response time
    R+ when CPU front runs (should be same as CPU burst time)

throughput
    sum of time for each process/number of processes
    ie: (1 + 9 + 5)/3 = 5 clock cycle
speedup over multiple cpus
    ?

---------------------------------
Assumptions:

- anything in the CPU queue is ready, the element at the front of the queue will be the process that is running
- if an IO burst amount is higher than a CPU's remaining burst amount, the process has to wait in the IO queue for an IO burst
- when IO burst is complete, it is moved back to the CPU queue, where it will be ready to finish the CPU burst
