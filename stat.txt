throughput time 
avg turnaround time - accumulated time in process
avg wait time - time in IO?
avg response time - time in CPU?
CPU speedup

so if process starts at time 2, does accumulated time count that
or only count the time in the process

acc = io burst + cpu burst + switch between queues
acc/turnaround = time in process, does not include arrival time - same as accumulated


--------------------------------
average turnaround time 
    should be W + R
    or 
    exit time - arrival time

average wait time
    W+ all elements in IO queue and all elements in CPUQ that are not front element

average response time
    R+ when CPU front runs (should be same as CPU burst time)

average throughput

speedup over multiple cpus
